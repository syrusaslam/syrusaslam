- 🌟 I have a passion for AI, machine learning, and software development.
- 🚀 Below are some of my projects and contributions:

## 🗂️ Projects

### [Predicting Volcanic Activity Using Infrasound Data](https://github.com/arnavsurve/ARC-NASA-CSGC-infrasound)
- **Description**: Developed an infrasound monitor using Raspberry Pi to detect seismic and atmospheric activity through NASA California Space Grant Consortium. Implemented k-means and agglomerative clustering and neural networks using scikit-learn and TensorFlow with over 25 million values to analyze infrasound wave patterns for predicting volcanic activity with over 90% accuracy. Preprocessed data and enhanced the infrasound machine learning model, boosting accuracy by 20%.
- **Tech Stack**: Python, TensorFlow, scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, obspy.

### [AI-based Skin Disease Detection](https://github.com/syrusaslam/AI-Skin-Disease-Detection)
- **Description**: Developed a convolutional neural network (CNN) using PyTorch for skin disease detection, achieving over 90% accuracy in classifying 8 types of skin diseases.Implemented a user-friendly web interface for seamless image uploads and real-time AI-driven disease predictions.
- **Tech Stack**: Python, PyTorch, React.js, HTML, CSS.

### [Music Genre Classification and Recommendations Using Machine Learning Models](https://github.com/arnavsurve/sampling)
- **Description**: Developed a music genre classification system using random forest decision trees to accurately categorize new songs based on their audio features with over 80% accuracy. Utilized scikit-learn, librosa, and pandas for efficient feature extraction, data processing, validation testing, and model training, ensuring high performance and reliability in music genre prediction.
- **Tech Stack**: Python, librosa, pandas, scikit-learn.
